## 💵 Google AdSense Integration Guide

We have optimized the layout of CricMilan.in to be completely **AdSense-friendly**. To start displaying real advertisements:

### Step 1: Add the Google AdSense Script
1. Open the header layout file: `views/partials/header.ejs`.
2. Locate the `<head>` section.
3. Paste the general Google AdSense Auto-Ads code block before the closing `</head>` tag:
   ```html
   <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
   ```

### Step 2: Paste Ad Unit Codes in Pre-defined Slots
To control exactly where your banner ads appear, paste your specific Google Ad unit code inside these three dedicated partial files:

1. **Header Banner Ad (728x90 Billboard):**
   - File: `views/partials/ads/ad-header.ejs`
   - Paste your top banner code inside this file. It will render below the site navigation menu on the homepage, category pages, and article pages.
2. **Sidebar Ad (300x250 Rectangle):**
   - File: `views/partials/ads/ad-sidebar.ejs`
   - Paste your rectangle ad code here. It will display in the right sidebar beside the main articles.
3. **In-Content Ad (Horizontal Banner):**
   - File: `views/partials/ads/ad-content.ejs`
   - Paste your inside-article ad code here. It automatically appears beneath the body text on all article detail pages and inside news grid columns.

## 🔍 SEO & Open Graph (OG) Sharing

Every article page generates a standardized **JSON-LD Schema block** dynamically, ensuring Google Search Console reads it as a valid `NewsArticle`.

When you share an article on **WhatsApp, Facebook, or X (Twitter)**, it reads these dynamic meta tags generated on the server:
- `og:title` / `twitter:title` - Injects your article title or customized SEO title.
- `og:description` - Injects the short Meta Description.
- `og:image` - Injects the path to the compressed featured image.

---

## 🖼️ Canvas Image Optimizer

To save server disk space and make pages load instantly on mobile, the Admin Editor features browser-side canvas optimization:
- If you upload a heavy 5MB image, the editor draws it on an HTML5 canvas.
- It resizes the width to a maximum of **1200px** (maintaining the aspect ratio).
- It exports it as a compressed JPEG/WebP at **0.85 quality**.
- The server saves the compressed image in `public/uploads/` (resulting in sizes under 200KB).

---

## 🗄️ Database Portability & Backup

The system runs on **SQLite** (a local, file-based database).
- All articles, admin details, and settings are stored in **`database.db`** at the root of the project.
- **Backup:** Copy the `database.db` file to a secure cloud drive or local USB.
- **Restoring:** Simply paste the `database.db` file back into the project root folder.

## 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide (100% Configured & Ready)

This repository is pre-configured to run on **Vercel Serverless Functions** with full support for Express, EJS template rendering, static asset routing, and SQLite storage in `/tmp`.

### Under the Hood Optimizations:
- **`api/index.js`**: Dedicated serverless entry point bridging Vercel and Express.
- **`vercel.json`**: Rewrites all routes to `/api/index.js` while bundling `views/**`, `public/**`, and `database.db`.
- **Cold-Start Resilience**: Built-in async database gating ensures zero crashes during serverless wakeups.
- **Dynamic `/tmp` Storage**: SQLite copies the initial seed `database.db` to `/tmp` for writable operations in Vercel.
