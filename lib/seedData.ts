      <p><strong>Bengaluru:</strong> In an extraordinary display of skill, focus, and longevity, Virat Kohli smashed his historic 51st One-Day International (ODI) century today at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium against a formidable Australian attack.</p>
      <p>Kohli, who walked in after the early dismissal of the openers, paced his innings to perfection. He combined caution with aggression, reaching the three-figure mark in just 92 balls, hitting 11 boundaries and 2 colossal sixes along the way.</p>
      <h2>The Record-Breaking Knock</h2>
      <p>With this century, Kohli further solidifies his position as the undisputed king of run-chases in ODI cricket. The Chinnaswamy crowd erupted into loud cheers as Kohli took a quick double off Mitchell Starc to complete his milestone, raising his bat and thanking the heavens.</p>
      <blockquote>"This is one of the most special knocks of my career. The pitch was challenging early on, but staying positive was the key," Kohli said in the post-match presentation.</blockquote>
      <p>India posted a mammoth total of 348 runs in their 50 overs, leaving Australia with a steep mountain to climb. Experts worldwide are calling this one of Kohli's most organized and technical centuries in recent years.</p>

      <p>A quiet revolution is taking place in Indian cricket. Gone are the days when the national team was dominated solely by players from metro cities like Mumbai, Delhi, or Bengaluru.</p>
      <p>Today, the backbone of the Indian squad consists of youngsters coming from small towns, villages, and humble backgrounds. Players from states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jammu & Kashmir, and rural Punjab are making their mark on the international stage.</p>
      <h2>Breaking Barriers</h2>
      <p>This shift is largely credited to the deep penetration of local academies, state-level tournaments, and the platform provided by domestic cricket and franchise leagues. These setups scout talent from previously untouched regions, giving them world-class facilities and exposure.</p>
      <p>As these players dominate global cricket with their raw hunger and resilience, they inspire millions of children across India's heartlands to dream big.</p>
